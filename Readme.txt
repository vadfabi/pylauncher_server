tcPIp Sockets
by LittleBytesOfPi.com

This project is a demonstration of how to put together a simple TCP/IP Socket server framework.  This program is offered so that anyone who needs a simple TCP/IP Socket server/client system for local area network remote control of an application running on a Linux machine can start here.

There are two parts to this project:

> tcPIp_Sockets:  a program showing a generic framework for a Linux server (C++) and Android client (Java) to send and receive messages using TCP/IP sockets.

> pyLauncher: a program, using the tcPIp_Sockets code example, that can lanuch python scripts on the Linux server using the Android client for a remote control.

Note:  This program has absolutely no security, and is therefore not suitable for use outside of a secured local area network.
